Here‚Äôs a dead simple example to POST and GET data from Elasticsearch using jquery - directly from the browser. Live dangerously.üåµ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ö°

Seriously, it's all in the browser! If you want to test locally...

4. Fill out `Address`, `Index`, and `Document Type` for your elasticsearch instance
5. POST and GET documents from ES!
